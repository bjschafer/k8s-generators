# Kubernetes using CDK8S

This uses CDK8S in TypeScript to build K8S deployments and such.

Some apps are deployed directly from this repo, others are used as a base for something in prod.

**IMPORTANT**: Before committing any changes, run `npm run fullbuild` to lint and build YAML. Or else
you're gonna have a bad time.
