This repository contains CDK8S definitions in TypeScript for my homelab Kubernetes cluster. Always use Context7 MCP server to look up API documentation for CDK8S. Always use cdk8s-plus when practicable, and include a justifying comment if you must fall back to base CDK8S.

Avoid adding new dependencies without getting confirmation from me first.

Do not create new documentation files or update the readme without getting confirmation from me first.

# Structure

- Shared code is in `lib/`. Try to keep things DRY and store things likely to be reused here.
- Use existing construts in `lib/` before building something new.
- Each app is in a subfolder under `apps`. By convention the folder name matches the Argo app and namespace name when possible.
- Each app subfolder must contain an `app.ts` file.
- Autogenerated manifests are located in the `dist/` folder. Never manually modify anything in there.
- I have some tooling in `tools/` to help with downloading CRDs for apps that need them.

# Building

- You can test changes by invoking `make`.
- Ensure files are formatted properly according to eslint rules. `make fmt` and `make lint` can be helpful here.
